# Data type

> "A data type is a collection of objects and a set of operations that act on those objects. For example, the data type int consists of the objects {0, +1, -1, +2, -2, ..., MAXINT, MININT}. The operations on integers are many and would certainly include the arithmetic operators +, -, *, and /. There is also testing for equality/ineqaulity and the operation that assigns an integer to a variable."[^datatype_definition]

# Abstract data type

> "In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user."[^adt_definition_1]

> "An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type that is organized in such a way that the specification of the objects and the specification of the operations on the objects is separated from the representation of the objects and the implementation of the operations."[^adt_definition_2]
