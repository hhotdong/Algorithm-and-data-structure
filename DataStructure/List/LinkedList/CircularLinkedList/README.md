# Circular linked list

> "In the last node of a linked list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value is used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'"[^circular_linked_list_definition]
